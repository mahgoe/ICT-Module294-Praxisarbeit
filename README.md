# ICT_Modul294_Praxisarbeit - Responsive Website "Jetstream-Service"

This project was developed based on the requirements of the ICT-Berufsbildung (www.modulbaukasten.ch) and the specifications provided by the lecturer.

The initial situation required creating a responsive web design for the fictitious company "Jetstream-Service". In this context, the online presence was to be expanded with an online registration for service orders.

The project and its accompanying documentation were created using the IPERKA method.
